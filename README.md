# Multimedia-Graph-Visualization
The **Multimedia Graph Visualization** project is designed to simplify the complexities of filter graphs by enabling visualization of data flow within a web application. This project is part of the [GPAC project](https://gpac.io/), focusing on creating an intuitive and interactive interface that allows users to understand and manipulate multimedia graphs effectively.

This is the research project I conducted for my M1 degree in [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en).

The project was supervised by Professor Jean Le Feuvre, and it is now completed.
