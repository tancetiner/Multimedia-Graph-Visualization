# Multimedia-Graph-Visualization

The **Multimedia-Graph-Visualization** project aims to simplify the complexities of filter graphs within GPAC by enabling real-time visualization of data flow within a web browser. This project focuses on creating an intuitive and interactive interface using responsive design principles, making it easier for users to understand and manipulate multimedia graphs effectively.

This project is part of the [GPAC framework](https://gpac.io/).

This is the research project I conducted for my M1 degree in [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home).

The project is supervised by Professor [Jean Le Feuvre](https://lefeuvre.wp.imt.fr/).

## Project Log

Follow the development progress of this project through our [project log](https://hackmd.io/@Cs7I3U-1QkmBjlGWMGXvwg/gpac-log), where we document milestones, challenges, and technical decisions.

## Setup

To run the web application locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tancetiner/Multimedia-Graph-Visualization.git

# Enter the directory
cd Multimedia-Graph-Visualization

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run on local port
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the local server address (e.g., http://localhost:3000 or any other port displayed in the console) to start using the multimedia graph visualization tool.
